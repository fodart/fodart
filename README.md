## Hi, I'm Vladyslav 👋

I'm a beginner developer currently learning programming.
My main focus is Python, and I also explore C# (.NET) and C++.

What I'm learning:
- Python: basics, automation, small tools
- C#: .NET, desktop applications
- C++: fundamentals, algorithms, memory basics

Goals:
- improve problem-solving skills
- write clean and readable code
- build small but complete projects
